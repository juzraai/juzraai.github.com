        <h1>Hi,</h1>

<p>I'm <em>Zsolt Jur√°nyi</em> from Hungary, I store and share my open-source projects here. I'm programming in Java, this language became my favourite as we first met in university. I develop mostly crawler applications, see my publication database crawler <strong>PubSearch</strong> and my current project <strong>HeritrixRemote</strong> (tough it's not a crawler but it controls a crawler :)).</p>

<p>Check out my <a href="https://github.com/juzraai?tab=repositories">repos</a>, and also my <a href="http://juzraai-en.blogspot.com/">blog</a>!</p>

<h2>My projects</h2>

<h3>HeritrixRemote (development in progress)</h3>

<p>I'm currently working on this application which is needed at work. The aim is to simplify controlling Heritrix 3.x crawler from the command line especially when you've got a lot of crawling jobs to manage.</p>

<h3>PubSearch (abandoned after 1.1)</h3>

<p>This was my thesis at university. It crawls websites of publication databases, fetches publications of the given author and stores them in a database. I stopped development at version 1.1 because it's not flexible enough to crawl any kinds of sites, so I moved on PubSearch 2</p>

<h3>PubSearch 2 (development paused)</h3>

<p>The crawling engines are now outside of the application, in 3rd party libraries, and PubSearch 2 will communicate with them thru an interface. PubSearch 1.1 crawler engine will be transformed to use that interface and bundled with PubSearch 2, so old crawler definition files for PubSearch 1.1 will remain useable.</p>

<p>The project was planned, started, but my time and motivation flew away somehow :S ... but maybe I'll continue it someday.</p>
