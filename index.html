<a name="hi" class="anchor" href="#hi"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hi,</h1>

<p>I'm <em>Zsolt Jur√°nyi</em> from Hungary, I store and share my open-source projects here. I'm programming in Java, this language became my favourite as we first met in university. I develop mostly crawler applications, see my publication database crawler <strong>PubSearch</strong> and my current project <strong>CORDIS Projects Crawler</strong>.</p>

<p>Check out my <a href="https://github.com/juzraai?tab=repositories">repos</a>, and also my <a href="http://juzraai-en.blogspot.com/">blog</a>!</p>

<p>This app/API can fetch information of all <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/">CORDIS projects</a>. There's a CLI for users, and there are handy methods for developers! :) It can download project pages and publication list JSON strings, extract information them, export data to CSV, ... and see the <a href="https://github.com/juzraai/Cordis-Projects-Crawler">feature list</a>! :D</p>

<p>My useful Crawljax Plugins. Currently there's only one: SaveHTML which helps you to save every DOM state to file. Filename and directory name will be created just as they are in the URL, so you can create a site mirror with Crawljax and my SaveHTML plugin.</p>

<p>Check out my URL2File class too, it can be useful in other cases too.</p>

<a name="heritrixremote-development-paused" class="anchor" href="#heritrixremote-development-paused"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="http://juzraai.github.io/HeritrixRemote/">HeritrixRemote</a> (development paused)</h3>

<p>I'm currently working on this application which is needed at work. The aim is to simplify controlling Heritrix 3.x crawler from the command line especially when you've got a lot of crawling jobs to manage.</p>

<h3>
<a name="pubsearch-abandoned-after-11" class="anchor" href="#pubsearch-abandoned-after-11"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PubSearch (abandoned after 1.1)</h3>

<p>This was my thesis at university. It crawls websites of publication databases, fetches publications of the given author and stores them in a database. I stopped development at version 1.1 because it's not flexible enough to crawl any kinds of sites, so I moved on to PubSearch 2.</p>

<h3>
<a name="pubsearch-2-development-paused" class="anchor" href="#pubsearch-2-development-paused"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PubSearch 2 (development paused)</h3>

<p>The crawling engines are now outside of the application, in 3rd party libraries, and PubSearch 2 will communicate with them thru an interface. PubSearch 1.1 crawler engine will be transformed to use that interface and bundled with PubSearch 2, so old crawler definition files for PubSearch 1.1 will remain useable.</p>

<p>The project was planned, started, but my time and motivation flew away somehow :S ... but maybe I'll continue it someday.</p>
