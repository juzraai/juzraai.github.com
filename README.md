# juzraai.github.io

This is my website which is a portfolio and a developer blog.

Since [GitHub Pages][ghpages] supports only a [strict list][supported] of Jekyll plugins, I do the site rendering at home. That's why the source code is on the [`src`][src] branch and the rendered site is on [`master`][master].
