# https://juzraai.github.io/

This is my website which is a portfolio and a developer blog.

Since [GitHub Pages][ghpages] supports only a [strict list][supported] of Jekyll plugins, I do the site rendering at home. That's why the [source code is in a separate repo][src] and the [main repo][master] contains only the generated site.

[ghpages]: https://pages.github.com/
